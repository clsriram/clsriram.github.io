Hi! I am C L Sriram. Welcome to my homepage.
<br/><br/>
I am a researcher interested in Theoretical Condensed Matter and Statistical Physics. I am currently working as a Junior Research Fellow at the Department of Theoretical Physics, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, India.

<br/><br/><br/>
## Research Interests
I am currently working on disordered one dimensional quantum systems. My work deals with the phenomenon of Many-Body Localization. 
<br/>
I have also worked on non-equilibrium systems like the asymmetric and symmetric simple exclusion processes. I study the effect of stochastic resetting on such systems.

Hi! I am Sriram. Welcome to my homepage.
<br/><br/>
I am currently a graduate student at the Department of Physics, University of Connecticut, USA.
<br/>
Major Advisor: Prof. Lea Ferreira dos Santos, Department of Physics, University of Connecticut.
<br/>
I am a researcher interested in Theoretical Condensed Matter and Statisticcal Physics.

## Research Interests
I am currently working on one dimensional disordered closed quantum systems with long range interactions. I am also fairly interested in the study of phemmomena such as Many-Body Localization and thermalization. I am currently working on disordered one dimensional quantum systems. My work deals with the phenomenon of Many-Body Localization. I have also worked on non-equilibrium systems like the asymmetric and symmetric simple exclusion processes. I study the effect of stochastic resetting on such systems.
